We will create a Different Repository where we will write notes. This repository will only having basic code.


A development container is a running container with a well-defined tool/runtime stack and its prerequisites. You can try out development containers with GitHub Codespaces or Visual Studio Code Or STS or any Other  Development Tools.

This is a sample project that lets you try out either option in a few easy steps. We have a variety of other vscode-remote-try-* sample projects, too.

Note: If you already have a Codespace or dev container, you can jump to the Things to try section.

Setting up the development container
GitHub Codespaces
Follow these steps to open this sample in a Codespace:

Build, Run, and Debug:

Open src/main/packagename
Add a breakpoint.
Press F5 to launch the app in the container.
Once the breakpoint is hit, try hovering over variables, examining locals, and more.
Run a Test:
